# MLProjectSamples
This repository contains some basic machine learning projects.

Note that this repository contains some sample projects that have been implemented for
the simplest solution possible. Therefore, some basic methodological steps
such as hyperparameter search, cross-validation etc. could be skipped.
Similarly some functionalities, such as pipelines in sklearn, are not applied. The
content is created by me.

1) NLP_newspaper_title_classifier: A project that uses three different 
approaches (random forest classifier, deep neural network and recurrent
neural network) to classify newspaper headlines.

Please note that the samples are "as-is". You use it on your risk.
